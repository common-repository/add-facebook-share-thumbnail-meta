Adds a perfect sized version of your post thumbnails for Facebook sharing purposes as well as image_src and og:image meta tags.

== Description ==

Many themes have the problem that they do not generate an appropriate thumbnail with according meta tag in your page head for use with Facebook's "Share" function.
So if someone pushes the share button on one of your posts or pages the suggested image would be everything _but_ your post thumbnail.

There are some rules to follow for preventing this, and this plugin takes care of them!

== Installation ==

1. Check if "add_theme_support('post-thumbnails');" is existing in your theme's functions.php file
2. If not, add this line!
3. Download the plugin, unzip it and upload the "fbsharethumbnail" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
4. Activate the plugin and regenerate your thumbnails (I suggest using the "AJAX Thumbnail Rebuild" plugin)
5. Enjoy!
